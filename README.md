ReCaptcha Home Page 
====================================
This is a ReCaptcha Home Page that requires a user to verify they are real before redirecting to another link.
This is built to be implemented in a period of high DDOS/DOS to only let the real user through and protect your site!
I enjoy making software so much! Please, if you see any issues make them known!
